** Single Channel Solenoid Driver

#+attr_org: :width 500px
[[file:./images/driver-v0.png]]

A prototype single channel solenoid driver was developed for testing.

It is contained in the ~driver-v0~ folder.

We will have 3 manifolds with 8 of these in a row that need to be driven with 12V and signalled with a TTL line. All the manifolds will act in unison.

** Octal Channel Driver

** Dual Channel Complementary Driver

We will also have a pair of these valves that need to be driven by a single TTL
line in opposition (if one is in state A the other should be in state B).
 - LHDA1231415H
 - https://www.theleeco.com/product/lhd-series-3-way-control-solenoid-valve/
 - One TTL input  + GND
 - Two 12V complementary outputs

The solenoids should be driven with a high-side switch using a peak and hold circuit.
